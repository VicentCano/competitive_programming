# Competitive Programming Training

This repo contains a nonexhaustive set of the competitive programming problems I solved to train for competitions during the last years. 
Some problems were solved when I was just starting to code in the first courses of my bachelor's degree, and others were solved during my master's.
This means the code on some of them is far from perfect and is not meant to be a reference for anyone, even though most of the problems here are ${\textbf{\color{green}AC}}$	's.
